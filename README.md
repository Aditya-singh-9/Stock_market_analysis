Stock Movement Analysis Based on Social Media Sentiment
Objective:
This project aims to predict stock market movements by scraping data from social media platforms, particularly Reddit, using sentiment analysis. The data will be processed, analyzed, and used to train a machine learning model that forecasts stock trends.

Project Overview:
Data Scraping: Scrape stock-related posts from Reddit using the Reddit API.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the scraped data for further analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on the data to identify positive or negative sentiments.
Machine Learning Model: Train a machine learning model to predict stock movements based on sentiment and other features extracted from the data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

Project Setup
This project requires Python 3.x and the following dependencies to run. You will scrape stock market-related data from Reddit, clean the data, perform sentiment analysis, and train a machine learning model.

Environment Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x (preferably Python 3.7+)
Reddit API credentials: You need to create a Reddit Developer account and generate your API credentials (client_id, client_secret, user_agent). These will be stored in a .env file.
Step-by-Step Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-movement-prediction.git
cd stock-movement-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
.\venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Install required dependencies: Create a requirements.txt file and include the necessary dependencies. Example:

txt
Copy code
praw==7.6.0
pandas==1.5.0
numpy==1.21.2
scikit-learn==1.1.1
nltk==3.7
python-dotenv==0.19.2
matplotlib==3.5.2
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Reddit API credentials: Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following content:

makefile
Copy code
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_reddit_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_reddit_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=your_reddit_user_agent
Make sure to replace your_reddit_client_id, your_reddit_client_secret, and your_reddit_user_agent with the actual credentials you obtained from Reddit's Developer Console.

Usage Instructions
1. Running the Data Scraping:
Run the reddit_scraper.py script to scrape data from the "stocks" subreddit.

bash
Copy code
python src/scraper.py
This will scrape the latest posts from the "stocks" subreddit and save the data to data/raw_data.csv.

2. Data Preprocessing:
Run the clean_data.py script to clean the raw data and save the cleaned data.

bash
Copy code
python src/preprocessing.py
This will process data/raw_data.csv and save the cleaned data to data/cleaned_data.csv.

3. Perform Sentiment Analysis:
Run the sentiment.py script to analyze the sentiment of the cleaned data.

bash
Copy code
python src/sentiment.py
This will analyze the sentiment and save the enhanced data with sentiment analysis to data/enhanced_data.csv.

4. Model Training:
Finally, run the train_model.py script to train the machine learning model using the enhanced data.

bash
Copy code
python src/model.py
This will use the enhanced data (data/enhanced_data.csv) to train a model and save it to a file (e.g., model.pkl).
